## Introduction

In this project, our goal is to classify the sender of emails found on Hillary Clinton's email server. We will use a word frequency table as our primary source of predictors, and will use 3 modeling approaches: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and K-means Clustering. We will compare the results of our supervised methods to select our final model.
